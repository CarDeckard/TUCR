\section{Background}
\justify

In a number of database environments, with applications such as weather, network traffic, crime, etc., %(list them, but only include scenarios that are amenable to updateable bitmap indices)
the industry standard practice is to generate pre-calculated summary tables which can speed up access to data.\par

A basic understanding of two concepts is required to sufficiently understand this material; the basics of bitmaps and the basics of Word-Aligned Hybrid (WAH) compression. \par

Bitmaps are two dimensional arrays where the rows represent tuples and the columns represent bins of binary vectors where a “1” represents that the tuple value is at that index location. This enables the ability to perform very fast logical operations onto a single column or group of columns rather than the entire dataset. For example, say we have a data type that has a number as well as a color. \par

For example, we will use the following list: [(3, Green), (4, Blue), (2, Red), (4, Red), (2, Blue)]. 
%3Green, 4 Blue, 2Red, 4Red, 2Blue . 
This would create a bitmap as featured in Fig. 1. From this we can find all Red numbers greater than 2 by using an AND of bins 3 and 4 as well as an XAND with the Red bin. \par

Word-Aligned Hybrid, or WAH, is a popular compression strategy used often as the benchmark against newly created compression strategies. The performance of WAH compression is primarily attributed to the way it processes data as words, or blocks of data whose size correspond with that of the CPU's architecture. An application of WAH in a system using a 64-bit CPU architecture would result in WAH being able to process a word of 64-bits at a time, and so on.
\par 
WAH compression is comprised of two types of words: fills and literals. Data that would constitute a fill would be a consecutive run of a single value, whose length is a multiple of one-bit less than a complete word. Data that would then constitute a literal word would be any combination of 1's and 0's, whose length is also one-bit less than a complete word. For 32-bit words, the fill words would store multiples of 31-bits, and the literals would store 31-bits, whereas in 64-bit words, the fill words would store multiples of 63-bits, and the literals would store 63-bits. 
\par 
In both cases, the remaining bit is used as an identifier, representing whether the compressed word is a fill word or a literal word, denoted as a 1 or 0, respectively. In the case of a literal word in 32-bit architecture, the identifier is set to 0 with the remaining 31-bits following. In the case of fills, the bit immediately following the previously mentioned identifier denotes whether the fill word is of 1’s or 0’s, with the remaining 30-bits represent how many multiples of 31 there are. \par

To show WAH compression we will first show a 128-bit hexadecimal number being compressed into both literal words and a fill word (Fig. 2). We will then feature two 32-bit WAH compressed hexadecimal numbers being AND’ed together (Fig. 3). As you’ll notice A starts out with a run of 1’s. Anything AND’ed against a 1 is just itself so we can just copy over the two first words of B. B than has a fill word that represents two runs of 0’s. As we can recall anything AND’ed with 0 is going to be 0. This means that we can just copy down the fill word into our result. Both of our last words are just literal words that can be AND’ed together without any special case. \par

RoaringBitmap is another popular compression strategy and the second compression algorithm that we compared. Roaring and WAH at their core set out to achieve the same goal. They are meant to compress bitmaps to save space in memory for large datasets. WAH uses RLE (Run-Length Encoding) to achieve this compression while Roaring is a hybrid compression that merges a sorted list and bitmap encoding. \par

\section{Methods}
Last summer, our team was able to design and build a small scale cluster system that allowed for jobs to be processed using the popular project management tool, Apache Spark. Through this system, we were able to imitate a server system as well as record power measurements along side total energy used. Due to our hardware setup already being constructed, we were able to begin this summer's research focused solely on comparing popular compression techniques and the ability to update such compressed data efficiently and effectively. \par 
As mentioned above, we decided to focus ourselves on the evaluation of the popular compression techniques of WAH and RoaringBitMaps. Due to the work that had been done prior, our software had to be based out of Python. This was not a problem initially, as we were able to find open source code on RoaringBitMaps directly from their website that was written in Python. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for WAH; there was no WAH implementation that was written in Python, so developing one was our starting point. \par
